    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><strong>The need for cybersecurity competence has become a strategic area for all types of organizations, be it large or small, for profit or nonprofit. This is an area of particular concern for smaller nonprofit organizations; 
	       and especially for those in rural areas with limited resources to address their cybersecurity risks. Cyber-attacks wreak havoc on the networks and systems for services provided to nonprofit consumers. The problems associated with various types of attacks, from outside nefarious individuals/groups or internal personnel, are particularly difficult for nonprofits in rural communities with limited resources for cybersecurity infrastructure and limited staff proficient in cybersecurity knowledge and skills.</strong></p>

    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) are vital for fostering equitable and thriving communities, with over 1.3 million NPOs operating in the United States. They provide essential services like food, shelter, and education, driving economic growth and employment opportunities for individuals of all backgrounds. Despite their significance, NPOs face increasing cybersecurity challenges as they handle sensitive data about donors and volunteers, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals. The recent surge in cyberattacks on NPOs highlights the urgent need for investment in fraud protection and security measures to safeguard valuable demographic and financial information. This threat is further compounded by the fact that more than 92% of NPOs are small, community-based organizations, emphasizing the critical importance of bolstering their cybersecurity readiness. Furthermore, NPOs confront unique challenges in building and maintaining trust with donors and volunteers, including high staff turnover, the risk of fraudulent transactions, ensuring secure access to their technology systems, and developing effective data breach procedures. The internal threats within NPOs have remained relatively low, but the number of external threats has surged by 630%, focusing primarily on collaboration services such as Microsoft 365, Zoom, and Cisco Webex. Worryingly, a significant 55.6% of NPOs do not require multi-factor authentication, leaving them vulnerable. Additionally, internal threats related to data access and breaches increased by 47% in 2020, further underscoring the pressing need for NPOs to address these cybersecurity challenges effectively.</p>

    <h2>II.DISCUSSION OF SURVEY TO BE USED </h2>
    <p>The research team met to review the objectives of the research study to reach concurrence on a common baseline of understanding about the types of data we would need to collect to develop a solid set of recommendations. Each researcher entered their questions into a Word document stored in a Microsoft Teams space that had already been established to collect other deliverables produced from this research effort. The team has met multiple times to refine the wording and organize questions with related themes into multiple logical groupings and eliminate duplicates. The survey questions cover eight key areas: </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Internal vs. External IT services and resources</li>
    <li>Website security </li>
    <li>IT and Security budgeting </li>
    <li>Current risk environment</li>
    <li>Business continuity/disaster recovery plan</li>
    <li>Physical security </li>
    <li>Logical access control</li>
    <li>Inventory</li>
    </ol>
	
    <h2>III.IDENTIFYING RURAL PA NONPROFITS</h2>
    <p> The research team is currently compiling a list of non profit organizations using information published on the Center for Rural Pennsylvania [9], TaxExemptWorld.com [11], and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development [14] websites. The Center for Rural Pennsylvania website [9] has several resources we used for determining which PA municipalities are classified as rural vs. urban. The county map provides a general classification of whether the county has a rural or urban designation. However, each PA county has dozens of municipalities within its borders with each one having their own specific rural vs. urban designation. Ultimately, we used a list published on this site that details which municipalities within each PA county are designated as rural vs. urban as our starting point for compiling the data we needed for this study. This table was imported into one of the tabs within an Excel spreadsheet that will drive our identification and distribution efforts. The last step in the process will be to identify one or more primary contacts within each rural non-profit organization that we will target with our survey. Since none of the reference sources mentioned previously included contact information with our searches, identifying this information will largely be a manual process by visiting their websites if they exist or other publicly available information. If the survey recipient turns out to be someone not in the best position to provide responses, we will include verbiage to encourage that individual to redirect the survey to someone else in the organization with the expertise to complete the survey. Furthermore, we hope to reduce the number of surveys we distribute by identifying an individual contact at an umbrella organization that shares similar policies and procedures with other affiliated operations wherever they may be located. The contact information will also be recorded with the other profile data we captured into our Excel spreadsheet in the previous steps. </p>
    
    <h2>IV.  SURVEY DISSEMINATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA</h2>
    <p> Survey distribution will be through the identification of the umbrella organizations followed by a snowball method described by Biernacki and Waldorf [15] for recognition and recommendations within the identified rural organizations. Qualtrics offers a Data and Analysis page that can be viewed if you are logged in with an account that has administrative privileges; survey responses can be viewed in a tabular format. The number of data rows shown on these pages can be controlled by applying filters to display selected data rows based on criteria programmed into the filter. Survey responses can also be exported from Qualtrics into multiple formats compatible with other analysis tools. The research team can drill down to each question and display survey responses as visualizations. This will be particularly helpful for multiple choice questions as it will present the responses with additional analytics including a statistical distribution of the responses recorded displayed in a tabular format and the number of responses recorded for each multiple-choice option displayed in a bar chart. These types of data visualizations will resonate with both non and technical respondents when sharing findings with the respondent organizations.   </p>
    <br>
    <h2>V.EXAMPLES OF SURVEY COVERAGE </h2>
    <p> Our survey questions are organized into eight (8) categories. </p>
    <ol>
	    <li>Internal vs. External IT services and resources – This section will give us insight into whether IT services and resources are managed internally by individuals employed within the organization or subcontracted to a third-party. The resulting data collection will give us quantifiable data to assess the challenges rural non-profit organizations may have in dedicating the level of support needed to properly secure the organization’s information technology assets against a cyber-attack. </li>
	    <li>Website security – This section includes questions that will help us determine whether the organization has a publicfacing website, what types of interactions the public can perform on the website (e.g., make donations, register for events, sign up for communications, etc.), and the types of security measures implemented to protect the site against breaches. We expect to draw parallels between how well an organization’s website is secured and whether the right level of support is involved in hardening the site and related host technology. </li>
	    <li> IT and Security budgeting – This section includes questions that will provide us with a baseline for whether rural non-profits allocate a portion of their operating expenses to information technology assets and how much of that part of the budget goes towards securing them. We hope to compare what rural non-profits spend on IT compared to for-profit entities and determine if there is a correlation between under-funded operations and the threat risk tied to those organizations. </li>
	    <li> Current risk environment – This section will help us determine each rural non-profit’s confidence level in any cybersecurity measures in place and gain a deeper understanding of their approach for implementing them. The responses should yield clear trends showing which organizations are more prepared than others for handling disruptions to their business operations resulting from a cyber incident.</li>
	    <li>Business continuity/disaster recovery plan – This section will help us determine how well prepared each rural non-profit is to recover from a major disaster or a cyberattack that could adversely impact and/or destroy critical IT assets. We will ask whether the organization has a plan for sustaining operations outside of their primary work location if the site became temporarily unavailable. </li>
	    <li> Physical security – We will assess what measures have been taken to secure the physical facilities where the rural non-profit’s employees work location. We will look for any gaps in any controls that expose vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.</li>
	    <li> Logical access control – We will collect input on how rural non-profits have implemented authentication and authorization within the organization. We will be looking for gaps in controls placed on application systems and data regularly accessed by employees, whether two-factor authentication is used, and determining whether a bringyour-own-device (BYOD) policy is in place that supports personal equipment being connected to the organization’s network. </li>
	    <li> Inventory – We will ask our respondents about their IT asset management strategy and whether they keep an up-todate record of IT resources in use throughout the organization. We are interested in knowing what assets are in use, whether audits of IT assets are being performed on a regular basis, and whether users that have been issued authorized equipment are following established acceptable use policies. </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>VI.CONTINUING WORK AND CONCLUSION </h2>
    <p> Rural municipalities of Pennsylvania have non-profits operating with limited resources to address challenges with integrating cybersecurity best-practices while cyber threat actors continue to increase attacks. Our continuing work will deliver specific strategies, techniques, and procedures that non-profits can use to strengthen their cyber posture within their limited resource constraints. Since we are still in the data collection phase of our research from rural non-profits, our preliminary best practices focus on best practices for small businesses including sound cyber hygiene practices, educating employees, and preparing for incident response that we will further tailor for non-profits after completing our data analysis phase. Participating non-profit organizations will be provided a “Best Practices” guide, based on NIST, CISA, FTC, and Small Business Administration (SBA) deemed most applicable, to assist them in implementing cybersecurity practices and standards as part of the overall research project. </p>
